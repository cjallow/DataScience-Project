what we need to confirm gentrification using taxi dataset and rental price dataset

# our hypothesis on gentrification: 
	If there were gentrification, the newly moved in people will use taxi rather than bus or subway. 

# preprocessing data

1. specify the region that we are interested in. 

2. For the region 
	- find out rental price changes for several years
	- filter the taxi data so that it includes only rows whose drop off or pick up locations are in the interested region
	-
